# BookStore
An app designed to maintain the inventory of a book store!

This project uses SQLite database to store information, integrating androidâ€™s file storage system into that database. It demonstrates seamless interaction between the data, Content provider, Loader, Adapter, and Activities. User input is validated and stored accurately, using Toasts to alert the user of any invalid entries.
